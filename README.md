# Video Denoising using Low Rank Matrix completion
Implementing Low-rank matrix completion algorithm for Video denoising and comparing it with other denoising algorithms like PCA and VBM3D method.

## Main Reference Paper
"Robust video denoising using low rank matrix completion" by Hui Ji, Chaoqiang Liu, Zuowei Shen, Yuhong Xu

## Validation Strategy
We will compare our results to that from the methods with impulsive noise pre-processing, like PCA and VBM3D, with respect to their PSNR values (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) and also visually.
